IMPORTANT KEYS
- R1 is the DHCP server
- vlan 10 192.168.3.0/28
- vlan 20 192.168.3.16/28

1. configure ssh on R1, R2 and SW2 to allow remote access from workstation

NOTE
- all configurations from this point MUST be carried out remotely from the WORKSTATION laptop
- statically assigning IP address and default gate to PCs is NOT ALLOWED as 
  proper configuration and troubleshooting will allow DHCP do this automatically.

2.REMOTELY configure VLAN 10 and VLAN20 on the appropriate switch interface(s)
- f0/2-4 VLAN10
- f0/5-7 VLAN20
3.REMOTELY configure router on a stick on R2 to allow for inter-vlan routing
3.Enable DHCP on the PCs.
- If network configurations are given then the lab is solved (unlikely lol)
- if configurations fail, TROUBLESHOOT!

EXPECTED RESULTS
- remote access to R1, R2, SW2 from the WORKSTATION
- DHCP assigns network configs to PCS in VLAN10 and VLAN20
- inter vlan communication
